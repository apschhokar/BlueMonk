Database Sync Strategies for Cloud Storage

Goal

Improve the android database cloud sync functionality. Basically we are wrapping sqlite db methods to provide 3 different sycing functionalities: -
1. Operations Log Approach 
2. Multiple Database Tables Approach 
3. File Chunking Approach 

Note

BlueMountainDroidsDB is a Database Implementation of BlueMountainSource and will be eventually moved to the BlueMountainSource repo 

This repo contains Android App Code as well as the Django Web Server (Python based Web Framework) 

Command Line Argument to run the Django Server is python manage.py runserver
